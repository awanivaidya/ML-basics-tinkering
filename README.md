# ML-basics-tinkering
A collection of experiments, mini-projects, and practice code while learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning. Covers essential topics like data preprocessing, visualisation, regression, classification, clustering, evaluation metrics, and basic model building.


# Description:

This repository is a personal playground for exploring the basics of Machine Learning through hands-on coding. It includes small experiments, example scripts, and practice notebooks covering foundational concepts.

## What’s Inside:

Data Exploration & Visualization – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Preprocessing – handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding

Supervised Learning – regression & classification models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

Unsupervised Learning – clustering (K-Means, hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA)

Model Evaluation – accuracy, precision/recall, F1-score, confusion matrices

Python implementations with clear, minimal examples

## Goal:

The aim of this repo is learning by tinkering – breaking down ML concepts into small, understandable pieces and experimenting with them in code.
